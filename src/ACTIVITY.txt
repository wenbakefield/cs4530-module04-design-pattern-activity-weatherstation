6. Compare the output of your new program to the output you got by running the original version. Are the lines printed in the same order? Why or why not?

Output:
Current conditions: 80F degrees and 65% humidity
Forecast: Improving weather on the way!
Heat Index: 82.95535063710001
Avg/max/min temperature = 80/80/0
Current conditions: 82F degrees and 70% humidity
Forecast: Watch out for cooler, rainy weather
Heat Index: 86.90123306385205
Avg/max/min temperature = 81/82/0
Current conditions: 78F degrees and 90% humidity
Forecast: More of the same
Heat Index: 83.64967139559604
Avg/max/min temperature = 80/82/0

They are printed in the order the observers are created in WeatherStation, which is different from the output of the original implementation.
When they are created, they are added to the array of observers in WeatherData.
This determines the order in which the data is displayed when notifyAll is called.

7. Can you modify the code so that the various XXXDisplay classes are all implementations of the same interface? Why might or might not this be a good idea?

The XXXXDisplay classes are already all implementing the same interface, and creating an additional one would be redundant.
The display method could be added to the existing WeatherDataObserver interface instead.
If we are going to create a new interface, there must be something totally different from the existing one.
Base on our code, one interface is enough to implement to all “displays”.
